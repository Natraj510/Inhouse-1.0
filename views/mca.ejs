                Centre for Online learning and Online Distance Learning, an initiative of BSA
                Crescent Institute of Science and Technology aims to offer full academic
                programs through Online Learning (OL) and Online Distance Learning (ODL)
                mode. Online Learning and Distance Learning is an important field which
                provides equal educational opportunities for those who do not have access to
                traditional classroom based learning.
                OL and ODL aims to reach out to all divisions of society in their quest for
                knowledge, to empower and enrich the learners with global standards of
                education. The Centre has a mission to provide a convenient platform for people
                of all ages to pursue their dreams of higher education, to facilitate lifelong
                learning, to learn in a free environment at their own pace, to provide clarity of
                concepts, to build in-depth functional domain knowledge and practical application
                using technology.
